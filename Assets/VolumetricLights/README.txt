Requirements & Setup
--------------------
This version of Volumetric Lights works only with built-in pipeline.


Demo Scene
----------
There's a demo scene which lets you quickly check if Volumetric Lights is working correctly in your project.


Documentation
-------------
Please read the documentation folder for additional instructions and options.

Future updates
--------------
All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Volumetric Lights will be eventually available on the Asset Store.


Version history
---------------

v7.1.2
- [Fix] VR Single Pass Instanced fixes

v7.1.1
- [Fix] Fixed cookie mipmapping issue

v7.1
- Small improvements to light diffusion effect

v7.0
- Added "Shadow Color" option. Shadow color can now be customized (also alpha) to create many special effects with Blend Mode.

v6.9
- Added Near Clip Distance to spotlights

- [Fix] Fixed material issue when a light is duplicated in Unity Editor

v6.8.1
- [Fix] Fixed translucent shadow map not being ready at frame 0 causing rendering issues with static lights

v6.8
- Added "Dust Prewarm" option. By default, dust particles are prewarmed/populated during activation. This behaviour can be disabled to gain performance when activating many lights at the same time.

v6.7
- Improved rendering of large area lights

v6.6.1
- Optimized mesh data reuse / generation based on settings change

v6.6
- Added "Local Space" option to "Use Custom Bounds"

- Translucency script: option to preserve original transparent shader
- Translucency effect uses also Lit shader base color
- Added cookie offset parameter

v6.3
- Added "Blend Mode" option to Cast Direct Light feature

v6.2
- Added "Substractive" blend mode
- Translucent shadow map: supports transparent texture scale/offset properties

- Added button to post process inspector to quickly return to latest selected volumetric light
- Fixes

v5.0.2
- Updated documentation with built optimization tips

v5.0.1
- [Fix] Fixed material keywords being reseted when saving scene in Unity 2021.3

v4.4
- New option Shadow Orientation for point lights
- Optimization related to baked shadows for point lights in OnStart mode

v4.3

- Using cookie texture no longer requires occlusion cam improving performance

v4.1
- Simplification. It's no longer required to create a volumetric light profile to use the effect.

v3.6.4
- Profile must now created specifically when using volumetric lights in prefabs

v3.6.3
- Improved dust particle rendering

v3.6
- Shadow pass optimization when dust particles are also enabled
