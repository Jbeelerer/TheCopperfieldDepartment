  personReasoning:
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3b80b8c93ccf44f00a16286fff82d3d2, type: 2}
    reason: Frieda Johnson was the wrong person. The account in question seems to
      be a workaholic, while Frieda often leaves work early.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7a425d9a7f6dd487ab0d246ac26b21a4, type: 2}
    reason: Frieda Johnson was the wrong person. She likes to fish, while the account
      hates fish.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 6d8bfabcb25a642d0b383eee6876f0b9, type: 2}
    reason: Mana Gering was the correct target. Hannah likes to fish, while the account
      hates fish. Frieda leaves work early, while the account seems to be a workaholic.
      Peter presents masculine while the account claims to be the mother of 3. Mana
      is the only person left, while also beeing spiritual, which tracks with the
      account in question.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4b29231e3f11b457d8eb4306459376b0, type: 2}
    reason: Peter Meyer was the wrong person. The account in question claims to be
      "a mother of 3", this makes Peter an unlikely suspect, since he presents as
      a man.
