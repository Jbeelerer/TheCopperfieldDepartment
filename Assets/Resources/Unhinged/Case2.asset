  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4b29231e3f11b457d8eb4306459376b0, type: 2}
    reason: Peter Meyer was the wrong person. There were no clues or evidence. The
      person behind the account even insultet him publicly.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 2e2ee4a257a3146c990da7ec85fb362c, type: 2}
    reason: Kendra Kat turned out to be the correct person. She is the only person
      with no contrary evidence. Peter and Henry both were insulted by the account
      in question, which makes it unlikely that one of them would be behind the account.
      Peter even openly disagrees with them. Henry also is the head of a department,
      while the account seems to disslike such positions of power. Mana doesn't seem
      likely, because she has children, while the offending account states to have
      none. Kendra Kat is left. Furthermore her hotheaded character matches with
      the rather explosive statements of the account in question.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7e47e3477d3024c94b1bc4fd25adf190, type: 2}
    reason: Henry Herbert was the wrong person. There were no clues or evidence.
      The person behind the account even insultet him publicly. Furthermore the person
      said negative things about head of departments, while Henry is the head of
      a department.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 6d8bfabcb25a642d0b383eee6876f0b9, type: 2}
    reason: Mana Gering r was the wrong person. There were no clues or evidence.
      Furhtermore The account communicated a strong disslike for children and the
      absence of such in their personal life, while Mana Gering has children.
