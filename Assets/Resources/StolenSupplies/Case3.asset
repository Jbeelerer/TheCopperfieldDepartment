  personReasoning:
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7e47e3477d3024c94b1bc4fd25adf190, type: 2}
    reason: Henry Herbert was innocent. The theft damages his image inside the company
      greatly. While he likes money, as the head of the finance department, he makes
      too much for the simple theft of office supplies to make a difference.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7a425d9a7f6dd487ab0d246ac26b21a4, type: 2}
    reason: Hannah Swan was innocent. Her not beeing part of the finance department,
      makes it impossible for her to access the facility.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4b29231e3f11b457d8eb4306459376b0, type: 2}
    reason: 'Peter Meyer was the correct person. It turned out he was in desperate
      need to scratch his rubber duck itch. He got desperate because of the raising
      rubber prices and turned to crime. As a finance employee he had access to the
      facilities. Furthermore there was a rubber duck visible in one of the photos,
      posted by the account. '
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f1cf7f42830be4e29bfb18af91422d04, type: 2}
    reason: Caren Cashed wasn't the culprit. While beeing an finance employee gives
      her access to the facilitie, her allergy to nuts prooves her innocence, because
      the thief was selling unpackaged nuts.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 67191a7368eff455fa4814b1fe466f6c, type: 2}
    reason: Harry Hopper was innocent. Him not beeing part of the finance department,
      makes it impossible for him to access the facility.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3b80b8c93ccf44f00a16286fff82d3d2, type: 2}
    reason: Frieda Johnson was innocent. Her not beeing part of the finance department,
      makes it impossible for her to access the facility.
