  personReasoning:
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7e47e3477d3024c94b1bc4fd25adf190, type: 2}
    reason: Henry Herbert is innocent. The theft damages his image inside the company
      greatly. Although he likes money, as head of the finance department he earns
      too much for petty theft of office supplies to make any difference.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7a425d9a7f6dd487ab0d246ac26b21a4, type: 2}
    reason: Hannah Swan is innocent. Because only employees from the finance department
      have access to the facilities in question, it would not have been possible
      for her to get access to the supplies.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 4b29231e3f11b457d8eb4306459376b0, type: 2}
    reason: "Peter Meyer was the correct person. It turned out he was in a dire need
      to scratch his rubber duck collecting itch. He got desperate because of rising
      rubber prices and turned to crime. The account \u201CW-Money\u201D seems to
      be a second account of his, so he could anonymously sell the supplies. As a
      finance employee, he had access to the mentioned facilities. Furthermore, there
      was a rubber duck visible in one of the photos posted by the account."
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: f1cf7f42830be4e29bfb18af91422d04, type: 2}
    reason: Caren Cashew wasn't the culprit. While being a finance employee gives
      her access to the facilities, her allergy to nuts proves her innocence, as
      the thief was handling unpackaged nuts, which was described as a rather messy
      situation.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 67191a7368eff455fa4814b1fe466f6c, type: 2}
    reason: Harry Hopper is innocent. Because only employees from the finance department
      have access to the facilities in question, it would not have been possible
      for him to get access to the supplies.
  - person: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3b80b8c93ccf44f00a16286fff82d3d2, type: 2}
    reason: Frieda Johnson is innocent. Because only employees from the finance department
      have access to the facilities in question, it would not have been possible
      for her to get access to the supplies.
