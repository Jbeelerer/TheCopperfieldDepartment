  title: Lunch Thief
  message: 'Good Morning,


    We got an employee complaint regarding a stolen lunch.
    It was probably stolen shortly before noon. These kinds of criminal offenses
    both hurt office morale and trust. Feelings of hunger can furthermore lead to
    less productivity, which is unacceptable!


    Good Luck,

    Terry Waldberg'
